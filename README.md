# firefox_border_issues

Basically i have a webpage that i have scaled down using the "viewport" meta tag.

The issue is that Firefox renders ALL my curved borders really blurry.

If an element has the following CSS applied while being viewed from a Bugzilla mobile browser, the resulting borders are really blurry/pixelated.
